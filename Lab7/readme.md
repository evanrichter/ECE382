Include whatever information from this lab you think will be useful in creating your program.

Test your sensors with a DMM. Ensure they are functional. What would good reference values be?

Consider how you'll setup the ADC10 subsystem. What are the registers you'll need to use? Which bits in those registers are important? What's the initialization sequence you'll need?

Consider the hardware interface. Which ADC10 channels will you use? Which pins correspond to those channels?

Consider the interface you'll create to your sensors. Will you block or use interrupts? Will you convert one sensor at a time or multiple?
