Simple Calculator Lab
===

Objectives & Purpose
---
This lab's objective is to give me practice in the assembly programming skills I have learned in class. Specific objectives include using the instruction set, addressing modes, conditional jumps, status register flags, assembler directives, and the assembly process effectively. The program I am implementing will take a series of operands and operations and store the results. It is a basic calculator.
