Subroutines & Cryptography Lab
===

Objectives & Purpose
---
The objective for this lab is to practice assembly code programming skills, specifically writing and working with subroutines. Two subroutines are required: one will implement pass-by-value and one will use pass-by-reference. The problem is to decrypt a string of cipher text that had been encoded with XOR. My three tasks are to decrypt cipher text of arbitrary length with a key:

1. of length 1 byte
2. of length multi-byte
3. that is unknown

The plain text will be in ASCII format.
